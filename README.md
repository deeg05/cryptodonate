# What ?
CryptoDonate is a website that will allow you to receive cryptocurrency from your users!
***
# Why ?
It was created because of the lack of cryptocurrency-enabled donation websites (patreon,utip,tipee,etc).
***
# Examples
My donation buttons at top of the README are great examples, you can use them for your own projects!
